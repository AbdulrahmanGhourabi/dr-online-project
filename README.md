# Dr.Online Portal

Dr.Online is a React-based web application for doctors and patients. Doctors can post medical studies, and patients can view them. Users can sign up and log in with their IDs. The app uses **React Hooks** such as `useState` for managing state, `useParams` for URL parameters, and `useNavigate` from React Router for page navigation. The project demonstrates form handling, conditional rendering, and client-side routing in React.
